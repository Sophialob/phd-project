        <h2>Coping and Help-seeking among Ukrainian Adolescent Girls and Young Women in the UK</h2>
        <p>This PhD project aims to explore coping and help-seeking among Ukrainian adolescent girls and young women (aged 15-24 years old) living in the United Kingdom (UK) since the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war in February 2022.</p>

        <h3>Why have I been asked to take part?</h3>
        <p>You are invited to participate because you are a Ukrainian adolescent girl or young woman who has moved to the UK since the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war.</p>

        <h3>Do I have to take part?</h3>
        <p>Your participation is entirely voluntary. You can withdraw at any time without giving a reason.</p>

        <h3>What will I have to do?</h3>
        <p>You will complete an online survey about your general health, coping strategies, and types of support you consider seeking in different situations. It will take no more than 15 minutes.</p>

        <h3>Possible risks and disadvantages</h3>
        <p>The survey may contain sensitive questions about your mental health. If you are experiencing severe mental health issues, this study may not be suitable for you.</p>

        <h3>Benefits of participation</h3>
        <p>Your participation will help us better understand how Ukrainian adolescent girls and young women in the UK cope and seek support for their mental health.</p>

        <h3>Confidentiality and Data Usage</h3>
        <p>Your information will be stored securely, remain anonymous, and be used solely for research purposes in compliance with UK data protection regulations.</p>
